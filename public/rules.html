<h1>Rules of Overthrow</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The goal is to be the last player with influence remaining. Influence is represented by your face-down cards. When you lose all your influence, you are eliminated.</p>

<h2>Game Flow</h2>
<p>On your turn, you must choose one action. Some actions can be challenged by other players, and some can be blocked. If your action is challenged and you were bluffing, you lose one influence. If you were telling the truth, the challenger loses one influence.</p>

<h2>The Cards</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Tax Collector:</strong> Allows you to take 3 Ducats from the treasury (Levy). Also blocks other players from taking Foreign Aid.</li>
    <li><strong>Warrior:</strong> Pay 3 Ducats to Attack another player, forcing them to lose one influence.</li>
    <li><strong>Thief:</strong> Steal 2 Ducats from another player (Thieve). Can be blocked by another Thief or a Courtier.</li>
    <li><strong>Courtier:</strong> Exchange your cards with the deck (Scry). Draw 2 new cards and choose which 2 to keep. Also blocks another player's Thieve action.</li>
    <li><strong>Defender:</strong> Blocks an Attack action against you. This is the only counter to a Warrior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Actions</h2>
<p>You can perform any of the following actions on your turn:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Harvest Crop:</strong> Take 1 Ducat. Cannot be challenged or blocked.</li>
    <li><strong>Smuggle Goods:</strong> Take 2 Ducats. Can be blocked by a player claiming to be a Tax Collector.</li>
    <li><strong>Levy:</strong> Claim to be a <strong>Tax Collector</strong> to take 3 Ducats. Can be challenged.</li>
    <li><strong>Thieve:</strong> Claim to be a <strong>Thief</strong> to take 2 Ducats from another player. Can be challenged and can be blocked.</li>
    <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Pay 3 Ducats and claim to be a <strong>Warrior</strong> to force another player to lose an influence. Can be challenged and can be blocked.</li>
    <li><strong>Scry:</strong> Claim to be a <strong>Courtier</strong> to exchange cards with the deck. Can be challenged.</li>
    <li><strong>Overthrow:</strong> Pay 7 Ducats to force another player to lose an influence. This action is absolute and cannot be challenged or blocked.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Special Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>10-Ducat Rule:</strong> If you start your turn with 10 or more Ducats, you MUST perform an Overthrow on another player.</li>
    <li><strong>Mercy Rule:</strong> You cannot Attack or Overthrow a player with only one influence (one card) if there is any other opponent with two influence remaining.</li>
</ul>
